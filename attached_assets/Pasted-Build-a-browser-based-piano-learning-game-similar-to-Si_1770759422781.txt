Build a browser-based piano learning game similar to Simply Piano, focused on one child and one song.

The app must allow the child to play the entire song from start to finish, not just a short excerpt.

The app runs entirely in the browser and uses the microphone to listen to a real piano being played. No backend is required.

Core gameplay:
- Guitar Hero–style vertical note lanes
- Lanes labeled with note letters
- Each falling note clearly displays its note name
- Notes fall toward a hit line
- When the played piano note matches the falling note (within tolerance), it counts as a hit
- No penalties for missed notes

Audio and pitch detection:
- Use the Web Audio API
- Request microphone access
- Monophonic pitch detection only
- Detect dominant pitch
- Map detected frequency to nearest piano note (including black keys)
- Ignore low-volume noise
- Use generous pitch tolerance suitable for a child playing an acoustic piano

Song scope:
Implement only one song: “I Can’t Wait to Be King” (The Lion King).
The song must be playable from start to finish (approximately 170 seconds).

Difficulty levels:
Implement only two levels.

Level 1:
- White keys only
- Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A
- Simplified but musically correct melody
- One note approximately every 1.5 to 2.0 seconds
- No sharps or flats

Level 2:
- Same song, same full length
- Adds black keys where musically required
- Includes notes such as Bb and F#
- Slightly denser note timing
- Still beginner-friendly

Do not add additional levels.
Timing rules are enforced only by the provided note charts, not by runtime logic.

Song structure:
Model the song using repeating melodic sections to cover the full duration.

Sections (use exactly this order):
INTRO
VERSE
CHORUS
VERSE
CHORUS
OUTRO

Level 1 section definitions (white keys only):

const INTRO = [
  { note: "C4", offset: 0.0 },
  { note: "E4", offset: 1.8 },
  { note: "G4", offset: 3.6 }
];

const VERSE = [
  { note: "E4", offset: 0.0 },
  { note: "G4", offset: 1.8 },
  { note: "A4", offset: 3.6 },
  { note: "G4", offset: 5.4 },
  { note: "E4", offset: 7.2 }
];

const CHORUS = [
  { note: "G4", offset: 0.0 },
  { note: "A4", offset: 1.8 },
  { note: "C5", offset: 3.6 },
  { note: "A4", offset: 5.4 },
  { note: "G4", offset: 7.2 }
];

const OUTRO = [
  { note: "E4", offset: 0.0 },
  { note: "D4", offset: 1.8 },
  { note: "C4", offset: 3.6 }
];

Expand these sections in order to build a full song chart of approximately 170 seconds.

Level 2 enhancements:
- Reuse the same section structure
- Add black-key notes (e.g., Bb, F#) in musically appropriate places
- Increase note density slightly
- Preserve melodic correctness

UX constraints:
- Extremely forgiving
- Large readable note labels
- Bright, simple visuals
- Positive feedback only
- No fail states

Code structure:
- Separate modules for pitch detection, song chart construction, rendering, and game loop
- Include comments explaining key logic
- Include instructions at the top explaining how to run the app in Replit

Start with the simplest working version and keep the implementation straightforward.
